# Venice Families and Real Estate

In this project we take the reader back in time, through our Venetian Time Machine, to two critical points in Venice’s history: 1748 and 1808. Rife with conflict, development, and Venetian love, these two period offer a look into the life before us. The composition of cities, the family power dynamics, and the cities progressions. We’ll call the data from 1748 the Catastici the data from 1808 the Cadaster. The Catastici and the Cadaster hold information about who owned buildings in Venice in the years 1741 and 1808. In order to find out how power shifted between families in this time, we will look at the change in real estate between these years.
