# Tasks
1. Preprocess the text \n 
	names right now don't really make sense
2. NER 
3. Dots mean it's unreadable 
4. Single names, double names,  

There is a group that did this 

## We need to use OpenRefine

- Affitto = Rent


--> 1. figure out rules
--> 2. create dataframes for families, official buildings, etc. 
--> 3. compare to existing list of families
--> 4. connect with wikidata/external information about families

sudetto/sudette/sudetta == item, same as before (parcel numbers!)
family names in capitals, depends on region (canareggio)
6 makro areas (column toponym shows areas e.g SM-> san marco, parish, name of streets)
no owner might be public space

filter family names using library of venetian family names
-> check for completeness of list 
measuring distance between list of names and cadaster corpus
catastici: we know who is noble (set of descriptions)
cadaster: no information who is noble, refer to external source 

ownership of public institution: REGIO DEMANIO (royal property) DEMANIO NAZIONALE(national property) -> demanio means public
commune di venezia, citta di venezia == public 
citta di venezia di provenienza della soppressa Scuola di s. marco => Information of previous owner
